## Description

A live score football app using the API from [football-data.org](http://www.football-data.org/index) to fetch
data about the fixtures and teams in Premier League. Also using [our own API](https://github.com/eriksvedenlund/teamData/blob/master/teams.json) to fetch additional data about the teams.

Sort the matches by day using [react-native-calendar-strip](https://github.com/BugiDev/react-native-calendar-strip) to see when the match is taking place, what teams are playing eachother and the current score. Press the information button to navigate to the about screen. Here you will find further information about the teams. Such as their emblem, what arena the match is taking place at and
the team coaches. We have also included the feature to see the match form of the teams, i.e if the four latest matches for each team ended in a draw, loss or win.
From this screen you can also navigate to the Premier League Table to see the current standing of the teams. How many games are played so far, draws, losses, wins and points.
